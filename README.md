tic-tac-toe game
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game build with React for my MIT xPRO class. Standalone.html file holds the React imports and the CSS styles, while tiktac.js holds the React components.

**Roadmap for Future Improvements**

I would like to be able to reset the game without having to reload the page.  I feel like I can do this with some logic to re-render the board triggered by a button that could be entitled "Start New Game."  I would also like to stop the squares from changing players when they are pressed again, as of this moment the squares do not hold the tik if pressed again which would make for a very confusing, if not 'violent', game of Tic-Tac-Toe
